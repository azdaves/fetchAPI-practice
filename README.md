Fetch API practice and some bootstrap. 

idea from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oive66jrwBs&t=187s  Traversy Media's tutorial

I added the fetch API to a UFC api that display's all of the current titleholders. I'm currently working on a UFC react app project and wanted to use a fetch api.

note: The UFC button won't work on chrome w/o this extension:
Use the google Chrome Extension called Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *. It modifies the CORS headers on the fly in your application.
